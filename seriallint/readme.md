## Seriallint

### 1. Overview
Seriallint tool built based on [Repo](https://github.com/AngryCarrot789/BasicSerialCommunicator)
This tool is used to simulate the serial communication of an engine.
For now it is used to simulate the **weighing indicator**.

### 2. Set up
- Firstly, we need a virtual COM port set up in local machine as pre-condition to run the tool. For now, I use the [Virtual COM port Application](https://freevirtualserialports.com/).
- Connect 2 devices into a virtual COM port (i.e. create a COM port with COM9 and COM10, then connect each device to a port and vice versa)
- Start simulating the function.

### 3. Support device:

#### Weighing Indicator (XK3190-D10)
